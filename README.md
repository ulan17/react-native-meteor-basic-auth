# react-native-meteor-basic-auth

This is my internship task. I was asked to create mobile app in React Native and server in Meteor.

To run React Native app, change METEOR URL in taskSaccess/meteor/connect.js;

React Native components:

 - AuthLoading
 - Login and Registration
 - Navigation Drawer (Home, Control Panel)

Meteor databases:

 - User default database (email, password)
 - Texts database (text, owner (user_id))
